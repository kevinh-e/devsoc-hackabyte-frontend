# TasteBuds

TasteBuds is a restaurant recommendation app for indecisive groups. Inspired by the fast-paced, interactive style of Kahoot, TasteBuds lets groups quickly decide where to eat by hosting a fun voting session. Each lobby gathers users who then vote on their favorite restaurant option, and the winning choice is displayed in real time!
